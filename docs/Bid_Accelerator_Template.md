## Actions performed in the Bid Accelerator Templates

The Bid Accelerator Template is designed to streamline the end-to-end process of preparing ISO -compliant bid templates. It enables users to open existing templates, import/export files, and input or seed data. Ensuring secure and collaborative bid preparation through API mapping, worksheet protection, and controlled editing. These actions collectively help deliver fast, accurate, and standardized bid submissions. The following are the procedures to perform different actions:

1. Opening a Template
1. Using API Mapping for Datasets
1. Importing and Exporting a Template
1. Protecting Sheet or Allow Edits

### 1. Opening a Template

The Opening Templates feature enables users to access, reuse, and review existing bid templates that have been previously configured with defined data structures, layouts, and formatting standards. This function plays a vital role in ensuring consistency, efficiency, and accuracy across bid preparation activities, particularly when handling recurring bid types, standard offer formats, or regulatory submissions.

1. Click on Bid Accelerator Templates under Bids and Offers Module.
1. Navigate to the File menu > New .

A blank template opens in the worksheet. The blank template provides a structured starting point, allowing users to input or import data consistently and accurately, ensuring alignment with the predefined format and simplifying future data processing or analysis.

### 2. Using API Mapping for Datasets

The API Mapping functionality establishes seamless connections between spreadsheet templates and backend data systems or ISO (Independent System Operator) APIs. This integration enables the automated population, refresh, and synchronization of data within bid templates eliminating manual data entry, minimizing human error, and ensuring that the bid models always reflect real-time, validated market information.

1. Click API Mapping from the File tab .
1. A Seed Data API Mapping Management dialog opens to map worksheet columns to external data fields.
1. Select columns, assign source fields, and apply mapping rules.
1. Save the mapping to automate future data population.

Saving the mapping ensures that the configuration is preserved for future reuse, enabling automated and consistent data population across similar datasets.

### 3. Importing and Exporting a Template

The Import and Export functions are essential tools that enable seamless data exchange, collaboration, and bid lifecycle management. They allow users to bring in external or saved templates for reuse or editing and to save or share the current bid template in a standardized format for review, documentation, or submission.

#### Import:

1. Click the Import button.
1. Select a saved template from your local or shared drive.

The template loads into the current workspace.

#### Export:

Once the template is created, review and confirm that all required fields are correctly populated and formatted.

1. Click Export .
1. Save it as a reusable file for documentation or ISO submission.

### Protecting Sheet or Allow Edits

The Protecting Sheet and allow users to edit ranges features are essential for maintaining data integrity, version control, and collaborative security within bid preparation workflows. These functions allow bid owners and administrators to define which parts of a worksheet can be modified, ensuring that critical formulas, calculations, and reference data remain intact while still enabling controlled collaboration among team members.

1. Go to the Review tab.
1. Click Protect Sheet to lock structure or formulas, then click on Allow Users to edit ranges to define editable zones.
1. Set permissions or passwords as needed.

The worksheet is protected to prevent unauthorized modifications, ensuring only authorized users can make changes.
